Ships are the same but with the word <b>ship</b> on the end funnily enough. ;-)";

If eithe side has more, then the other side's are nullified, and the winning ship gets to use its EWP's to do some damage.<p>Noting that EWP's have attack, and defense values, these are calculated seperatly. The system then uses the defensive amount of the EWP to try and stop the other ships defensive turrets. Whichever does the more damage wins, and whatever damage is done is taken from the winner, whilst the loosing upgrade doesn't take any more part within the battle as it's been nullified.<br>If there is any defensive EWP charge left, it is then directed at the opposing ships offensive turrets. The same happens here as with the defensive turrets.<br>The remaining defensive EWP charge (if any) is then merged with the offensive EWP charge. This charge is then used to destroy enemy fighters.<p>Defensive Turrets<br>Provided that the defensive turrets on the ship, and they survived the EWP onslought (if there was one), they will now come into play.<br>What these do is destroy enemy fighters.

These are both the Pea Shooters, and the plasma cannons, and their damage is total is added together to give the offensive turret damage capacity.<br>This damage is then flung at the enemy Silicon armour if there is any. If it is stopped, then the Offensive turrets are out for the round, and the silicon armour takes that much damage.<br>Otherwise they kill the silicon armour and work their way towards the shields, which they proceed to try and destroy.<br>If any shots get through the shields too, they then set about destroying fighters.<br>Should all the fighters be destroyed, then they will destroy the ship.<p>Fighter damage<br>Assuming the ship wasn't destroyed and has some fighters on it, then its time to figure out how much damage they should do. Below is a complete listing of how the fighters damage is calculated.<p>Whatever fighters survived the defensive turrets are used.<br>The damage done is 65% of the fighters on the attacking ship, and 85% on the defending ship.<br>This number then gets randomised by up to 6% plus or minus.<p>The resulting attack/counter attack number is then modified in the following ways once the total percentage modifiers have been worked out:";

This can be up to 20%! (but that would require killing about 130 HM's with that ship).<p>It is then time to take in the configuration of the ship:<br>battleship = +10% dam done<br>hs = +3.5% dam done<br>ls = +1% dam done<br>sc = +5% dam done<br>fr = +4% dam done<br>po = +25% dam taken!<br>fr = -7.5% dam taken<br>hs = -4.5% dam taken<br>ls = -3% dam taken<p>At this point the damage done and damage taken modifying percentages are then used on the total damages to figure out the final numbers.<br>This damage is then thrown at the silicon armour.

It does 100% damage!.<br>Scanners and freighter configs also serve no purpose against planets.<br>And of course planets don't have armour or turrets to defend themselves these days.<P>And that is the attacking system.
